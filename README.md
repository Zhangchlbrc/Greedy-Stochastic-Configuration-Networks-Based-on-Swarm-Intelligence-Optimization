We are excited to introduce **GSCN (Greedy Stochastic Configuration Network)**, a novel neural network framework that integrates **intelligent optimization algorithms** with **stochastic configuration networks** to address complex, ill-posed problems. Unlike traditional approaches, GSCN dynamically configures network parameters through a greedy stochastic strategy, combining the efficiency of random weight initialization with adaptive optimization. This innovative hybrid design enables **accelerated convergence rates** while maintaining robustness in tackling high-dimensional or noisy data challenges, such as inverse problems and ill-conditioned systems.  

For researchers and practitioners interested in scalable solutions for nonlinear modeling, GSCN offers a promising avenue for exploration. We warmly welcome collaborations, feedback, and discussions to further advance this work. To support open science, we plan to release a series of open-source implementations and benchmarks in the near future.  

If this aligns with your research interests, please feel free to cite our foundational work on GSCN (references to be provided in subsequent publications). Letâ€™s explore the potential of intelligent optimization-driven neural networks together!
